TODO:
- integrate the BBB's built-in PWM calls into the python code for the client,
   replacing the arduino servo calls... and TEST the crap out of it.
- refine error handling to allow the user to more easily close the scripts


EVENTUALLY:
- generalize for different joystick/gamepad/controller options
- detail necessary init scripts and extra hardware for better functionality
